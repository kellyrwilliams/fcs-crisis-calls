# Family and Children Services Crisis Calls

[Family and Children Services of Nashville](http://www.fcsnashville.org/) operates a Crisis Call Center. When calls come in, call takers use a form to indicate the various issues the individual is experiencing:

If an individual is experiencing multiple issues, the issues can be grouped together into a single cell, which makes understanding individual issues difficult. For this project you will parse the data from the different `CRISIS Issues` columns to allow deeper investigation of each individual issue. You will then explore, analyze, and visualize the data to gain insights into the calls and issues and then **present your findings and any recommendations back to Family and Children Services in a 45 min class presentation**.

The columns that contain the information about the documented issues are those that begin with `CRISIS Issues`. Your analysis should focus on these columns but does not need to be limited to them. 

The data are directly from the call center and have not been cleaned. You may experience issues reading the data into Jupyter Notebook. If you encounter an error, paste it into google and include `pandas` in the search for the most relevant results.
